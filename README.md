# Python-P2P-Chat-Application
A command line-based, peer-to-peer chat application that, if executed in a compatible command line, supports emojis.

###Disclaimer
By default, Windows Powershell does not support emojis. As such, attempting to run this application through Windows Powershell will yield question mark boxes in place of any emojis your chat partner sends you. To fix this, I recommend Windows Terminal (Preview) from the Windows store. This terminal DOES support emojis, allowing the application to correctly print emojis. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/c4urgw/how_to_display_emojis_in_windows_terminal/) is a link to a Reddit post which told me about Windows Terminal (Preview), and has some more information on implementing emojis in other code.
